When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you work on different workstation and/or with partners around the clock
  When you prefer to back-up your git repositery 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because shared git has an higher quality, so it is an extra safety not to do it automatically!
