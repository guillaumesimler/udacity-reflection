When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you work on different workstation and/or with partners around the clock
  When you prefer to back-up your git repositery 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because shared git has an higher quality, so it is an extra safety not to do it automatically!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A branch is a seperation of your code version on your LOCAL machine. After a certain commit (parent) you might want to try several options
	A clone is a copy of your repository
	A fork is a copy of a Github repository to someone else's GitÂ´hub repository
