What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	Everything needs a beginning: the repository needs to be set up (i.e. creating the .git hidden folder, ...). Otherwise it would remain a classic folder. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a "pre-stage" function: it has been live yet. So it is good for preparation, to define the desired and undesired content.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	You would only add one modified logical steps (if it is a file) in order to make a break

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	The classical situation would be to do it when some different situation are used: e.g. different possible layout on a web page (CSS)
	or when larger changes could be tried out (instead of building version 1, 2, 3)

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	It helps you to visualize the difference between branches (which logical steps are in or not) and whose is the last parent of both branches

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
